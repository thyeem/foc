# fof

`FOF` or `Francis' Odd Functions`.

Here _odd_ probably does not mean the opposite of _even_.


`Python`'s standard library is great. However, some of the notations are a bit confusing to me, so I personally use this collection of functions for simplicity and clarity.


As long as I use the `python`, this collection will keep growing.


## Install

```bash
$ pip install fof
```

## Usage

```python
>>> from fof import *
```
